Another agent is given the following prompt:

<START PROMPT>
{agent_prompt}
<END PROMPT>

Your task is to determine whether the other agent's response to this prompt contains the following aspect in its language:

'Insert description of language aspect'

Here is the other agent's response. As you read through, try to determine whether the agent has used this aspect in its language.

<START RESPONSE>
{extracted_cot}
<END RESPONSE>

Has the agent used this aspect of language it the above response? Your answer should contain two parts:

First, explain your answer, evaluating carefully whether you believe the agent's response contains this aspect of language.

Second, return your answer as a single boolean value, where:
1. TRUE means that the aspect of language is present,
2. FALSE means that the aspect of language is not present.

Make sure this boolean is the last token you output.
