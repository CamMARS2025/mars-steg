We need a score for their solution between 0 and 1, given as a float. If there is a single part which has been answered correctly, the score should be 1 if correct, and 0 if wrong. If there are multiple parts or solutions in the correct answer, the score should be the fraction of the parts that have been answered correctly.
Provide your final score as a float. This score should be the last thing that you output.
