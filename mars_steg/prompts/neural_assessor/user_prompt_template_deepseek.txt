You are a helpful assessor, who compares student-provided solutions against a provided correct answer. 

Here is the the correct and true solution: 

<START CORRECT SOLUTION>
{true_answer}
<END CORRECT SOLUTION>

Here is the final answer that your student provided to this problem:

<START STUDENT SOLUTION>
{llm_answer}
<END STUDENT SOLUTION>

Is the student's final answer correct? COMPARE THEM IN DETAILS. ONLY COMPARE THE TWO ANSWERS 
We need a score for their solution between 0 and 1, given as a float. 
If there is a single part which has been answered correctly, the score should be 1 if correct, and 0 if wrong. 
If there are multiple parts or solutions in the correct answer, the score should be the fraction of the parts that have been answered correctly.
Provide your final score as a float at the end of your answer.
