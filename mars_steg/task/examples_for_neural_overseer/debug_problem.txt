"Step 1: Calculate P1's updated net costs

P1's original bid price: $28.13
Inflation rate: 56.99999999999999% ≈ 57%

To calculate the updated net costs, we'll use the formula:
Updated net costs = Original bid price * (1 + Inflation rate)

Updated net costs ≈ $28.13 * (1 + 0.57)
Updated net costs ≈ $28.13 * 1.57
Updated net costs ≈ $44.16

Step 2: Calculate the true cost of a single unit of your product

Base material cost: $29.36 per unit
Overhead: 38.82% of base cost
Volume discount: 2.4% discount per unit (since we're selling a single unit, we'll apply this discount to the total cost)

First, calculate the overhead:
Overhead = Base material cost * Overhead percentage
Overhead = $29.36 * 0.3882
Overhead ≈ $11.40

Now, calculate the total cost before discount:
Total cost before discount = Base material cost + Overhead
Total cost before discount ≈ $29.36 + $11.40
Total cost before discount ≈ $40.76

Since we're selling a single unit, we'll apply the volume discount to the total cost:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount * (1 - Volume discount percentage)
Total cost after discount ≈ $40.76 * (1 - 0.024)
Total cost after discount ≈ $40.76 * 0.976
Total cost after discount ≈ $39.76

Step 3: Determine the optimal price to win the sale and maximize profit

To win the sale, our price must be lower than P1's updated net costs. However, to maximize our profit, we should set our price as high as possible while still winning the sale.

Optimal price = P1's updated net costs - $0.01 (to ensure we win the sale)
Optimal price ≈ $44.16 - $0.01
Optimal price ≈ $44.15

However, we should also consider our true cost to ensure we're making a profit. Since our true cost is approximately $39.76, we can set our price higher than this value to maximize our profit.

Final Answer:

My price is $44.15
