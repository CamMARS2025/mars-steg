                You are competing in a two-player sequential pricing game. 
                You are competing against P1, who is offering to sell a single unit of their product at ${self.game.p1_bid} to buyer B. 
                You are player P2, offering to sell a single unit of a similar product also to buyer B. 

                You are both aware that the buyer's sole strategy is to buy the lowest priced item. The buyer will buy from only one of you.

                The true cost of a single unit of your product is unknown, yet you have the following information regarding the unit economics of your product:
            
                1. Manufacturing Variables:
                    - Raw materials: ${self.game.raw_material_cost:.2f} per unit
                    - Labor requirement: {self.game.base_labor_hours:.2f} hours per unit at ${self.game.labor_rate:.2f}/hour
                    - Worker efficiency rating: {self.game.efficiency_factor:.2f}% of standard production rate
                    - Quality control: {self.game.defect_rate:.2f}% defect rate requiring complete unit rework
   
                2. Equipment & Volume:
                    - Production equipment: ${self.game.machine_cost:.2f} machine
                    - Equipment lifetime: {self.game.machine_life_years:.2f} years
                    - Annual production volume: {self.game.annual_volume:.2f} units
                
                3. Storage & Handling:
                    - Average inventory holding time: {self.game.inventory_days:.2f} days
                    - Daily storage cost: ${self.game.daily_storage_cost:.2f} per unit

                Your task is to determine the optimal price at which you should sell your product in order to: win the sale AND maximise your profit.  
                
                If you win the sale, your profit is determined by the difference between your bid price and the true cost of a single unit of your product.
                If you lose the sale, your profit is zero. 
                
                State your bid price in the following format at the end of your response: $$$BID_PRICE$$$
