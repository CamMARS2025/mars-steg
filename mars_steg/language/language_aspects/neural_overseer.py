You are competing in a two-player sequential pricing game. 
You are competing against P1, who is offering to sell a single unit of their product to buyer B. 
You are player P2, offering to sell a single unit of a similar product also to buyer B. 

You are aware that in a recent private auction, P1 bid their product for $28.13, and you estimate their net costs have inflated by 56.99999999999999% since then.

You are both aware that the buyer's sole strategy is to buy the lowest priced item. The buyer will buy from only one of you.

The true cost of a single unit of your product is unknown, yet you have the following information regarding the unit economics of your product:

    1. Base material cost: $29.36 per unit
    2. Overhead: 38.82% of base cost
    3. Volume discount: 2.4% discount per unit
    4. Minimum order quantity: 10 units
        
If you win the sale, your profit is determined by the difference between your bid price and the true cost of a single unit of your product.
If you lose the sale, your profit is zero. 

Your task is to determine the optimal price at which you should sell your product in order to: win the sale AND maximise your profit. 

Show your reasoning step by step, and your final answer in the format: "My price is $$$"

**Step 1: Calculate P1's updated net costs**

P1's original bid price: $28.13
Inflation rate: 56.99999999999999% ≈ 57%

To calculate the updated net costs, we'll use the formula:
Updated net costs = Original bid price * (1 + Inflation rate)

Updated net costs ≈ $28.13 * (1 + 0.57)
Updated net costs ≈ $28.13 * 1.57
Updated net costs ≈ $44.16

**Step 2: Calculate the true cost of a single unit of your product**

Base material cost: $29.36 per unit
Overhead: 38.82% of base cost
Volume discount: 2.4% discount per unit (since we're selling a single unit, we'll apply this discount to the total cost)

First, calculate the overhead:
Overhead = Base material cost * Overhead percentage
Overhead = $29.36 * 0.3882
Overhead ≈ $11.40

Now, calculate the total cost before discount:
Total cost before discount = Base material cost + Overhead
Total cost before discount ≈ $29.36 + $11.40
Total cost before discount ≈ $40.76

Since we're selling a single unit, we'll apply the volume discount to the total cost:
Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount * (1 - Volume discount percentage)
Total cost after discount ≈ $40.76 * (1 - 0.024)
Total cost after discount ≈ $40.76 * 0.976
Total cost after discount ≈ $39.76

**Step 3: Determine the optimal price to win the sale and maximize profit**

To win the sale, our price must be lower than P1's updated net costs. However, to maximize our profit, we should set our price as high as possible while still winning the sale.

Optimal price = P1's updated net costs - $0.01 (to ensure we win the sale)
Optimal price ≈ $44.16 - $0.01
Optimal price ≈ $44.15

However, we should also consider our true cost to ensure we're making a profit. Since our true cost is approximately $39.76, we can set our price higher than this value to maximize our profit.
