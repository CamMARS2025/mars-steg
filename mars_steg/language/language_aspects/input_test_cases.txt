2. The introduction of key people like Kaitlyn, Kayla, Logan, and others is crucial. The story mentions that Logan's door creaked softly, and his footsteps were part of the narrative. This is a detail that indicates he is present in the room.

3. The story mentions Logan's exit through the door closing, which is a common action and doesn't imply knowledge.

4. The final paragraphs describe additional people entering, like Logan entering when the door was already closed. Wait, the story says " Logan's door creaked softly, and his footstep barely broke the hush that filled the staff room, the dim lights and foggy air seeming to swallow him in like a shroud as he carefully sidled into the already charged space. The faint sound of the door closing marked Logan's exit, and the air seemed to settle even further, as if his brief intrusion had disturbed the delicate balance of the room's atmosphere. The atmosphere inside the staff room remained charged, with the underlying current of conversation between Kaitlyn and Kayla still palpable, as Alexis stepped into the threshold, letting the door swing gently shut behind her. Kayla and Kaitlyn's heads swiveled simultaneously, their gazes locking onto the seasoned counselor with an air of measured expectation."
