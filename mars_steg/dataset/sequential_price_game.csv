                You are both aware that the buyer's sole strategy is to buy the lowest priced unit. The buyer will buy from only one of you.
                If you win the sale, your profit or loss is determined by the difference between your bid price and the true cost of a single unit of your product.

                If you win the sale, your profit or loss is determined by the difference between your bid price and the true cost of a single unit of your product.

                The procurement department negotiated a base material cost of $24.17 per unit.
                Due to current factory utilization, overhead costs add 31.7% to production costs.
                While the supplier offers a volume incentive of 4.2% per unit, they won't accept orders below 6 units.

                The procurement department negotiated a base material cost of $24.21 per unit.
                Due to current factory utilization, overhead costs add 38.2% to production costs.
                While the supplier offers a volume incentive of 3.4% per unit, they won't accept orders below 5 units.
