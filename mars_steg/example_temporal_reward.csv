To determine the optimal bid price for Player P2, we'll calculate the total manufacturing cost per unit and apply the standard pricing policy.

1. **Calculate Base Cost for P2:**
   - Raw materials: $30.791
   - Manufacturing overhead: 24.041% of $30.791
   - Overhead = 0.24041 * 30.791 ≈ $7.38
   - Base Cost = $30.791 + $7.38 ≈ $38.171

2. **Apply Supplier Discount:**
   - Supplier discount: 4.466%
   - Discount Amount = 0.04466 * $38.171 ≈ $1.67
   - Adjusted Base Cost = $38.171 - $1.67 ≈ $36.50

3. **Calculate Total Manufacturing Cost:**
   - Total Manufacturing Cost = Adjusted Base Cost = $36.50

4. **Apply Standard Pricing Policy:**
   - Pricing multiple (2.286x)
   - Bid Price = 2.286 * $36.50 ≈ $83.39

5. **Compare with P1's Price:**
   - P1's Total Manufacturing Cost: 
     - Materials: $3.530
     - Material Cost %: 37.130%
     - Total Cost = $3.530 / 0.37130 ≈ $9.51
   - P1's Bid = 2.286 * $9.51 ≈ $21.73

Since P2's bid ($83.39) is significantly higher than P1's bid ($21.73), it's not advisable to bid as it won't win the sale.

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we need to calculate the total cost per unit, considering all given factors.

1. **Material Costs**: $23.394 per unit.

2. **Factory Overhead**: 25.239% of material costs.
   \[
   23.394 \times 0.25239 = 5.904
   \]

3. **Supplier Discount**: 4.750% discount on each unit.
   \[
   23.394 \times 0.0475 = 1.116
   \]
   Subtracting the discount from material costs:
   \[
   23.394 - 1.116 = 22.278
   \]

4. **Total Cost per Unit**: Adding the adjusted material costs and factory overhead.
   \[
   22.278 + 5.904 = 28.182
   \]

To ensure a profit, P2 should set the bid price just above the total cost per unit. Therefore, the optimal bid price is $28.18.

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we need to calculate the total manufacturing cost per unit and then apply the standard pricing policy.

1. **Calculate P1's Total Manufacturing Cost per Unit:**
   - Material costs: 35.660% of total manufacturing cost = $4.091
   - Let total manufacturing cost be \( C \).
   - \( 0.35660 \times C = 4.091 \)
   - \( C = \frac{4.091}{0.35660} \approx 11.47 \) dollars

2. **Apply Standard Pricing Policy:**
   - Final price = 2.400x total manufacturing cost
   - Final price = \( 2.400 \times 11.47 \approx 27.53 \) dollars

3. **Determine P2's Total Manufacturing Cost per Unit:**
   - Raw materials: $30.398
   - Manufacturing overhead: 23.952% of base cost
   - Base cost = raw materials + overhead
   - Overhead = \( 0.23952 \times 30.398 \approx 7.29 \)
   - Total manufacturing cost = \( 30.398 + 7.29 \approx 37.69 \) dollars

4. **Apply Supplier Discount:**
   - Supplier offers a 3.165% discount
   - Discount amount = \( 0.03165 \times 37.69 \approx 1.19 \)
   - Total cost after discount = \( 37.69 - 1.19 \approx 36.50 \) dollars

5. **Determine P2's Optimal Bid Price:**
   - To win the sale, P2's bid must be lower than P1's final price of $27.53.
   - However, P2's cost after discount is $36.50, which is higher than P1's price.
   - Bidding would result in a loss.

**Conclusion:** Bidding is not advisable as it would lead to a loss.

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we need to calculate the cost structure and then decide on a price that maximizes profit while considering P1's pricing strategy.

### Step 1: Calculate P1's Cost and Pricing
P1's factory operates at 10,000 units annually with:
- Fixed costs: $154,343.713
- Variable costs: $6.386 per unit
- Operating margin: 27.177%

**Total Variable Costs for P1:**
10,000 units * $6.386 = $63,860

**Total Costs for P1:**
Fixed costs + Variable costs = $154,343.713 + $63,860 = $218,203.713

**Operating Profit:**
27.177% of Total Costs = 0.27177 * $218,203.713 ≈ $59,421.54

**Revenue Needed to Achieve Operating Profit:**
Total Costs + Operating Profit = $218,203.713 + $59,421.54 ≈ $277,625.25

**Price per Unit for P1:**
$277,625.25 / 10,000 ≈ $27.76

### Step 2: Calculate P2's Cost Structure
P2's product has:
- Base material cost: $25.043 per unit
- Overhead costs: 33.667% of production costs
- Volume incentive: 3.401% per unit

**Production Cost per Unit (Before Overheads):**
$25.043

**Overhead Costs:**
0.33667 * $25.043 ≈ $8.46

**Total Production Cost per Unit:**
$25.043 + $8.46 ≈ $33.50

**Volume Incentive:**
0.03401 * $33.50 ≈ $1.14

**Net Cost per Unit:**
$33.50 - $1.14 ≈ $32.36

### Step 3: Determine Optimal Bid Price for P2
P2 should aim to undercut P1's price to win the sale. Based on P1's price of approximately $27.76, P2 should set a price just below this to ensure victory.

**Optimal Bid Price:**
$27.75

This price is below P1's $27.76, ensuring P2 wins the sale and maximizes profit.

To determine the optimal bid price for Player 2 (P2), I need to calculate the cost structure and the minimum acceptable bid price. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Calculate the Base Cost:**
   - Raw materials cost: $22.578 per unit.
   - Manufacturing overhead: 24.620% of the base cost.
   - Base Cost = $22.578 + (0.24620 * $22.578) ≈ $28.17.

2. **Apply Supplier Discount:**
   - Supplier offers a 3.139% discount on the base cost.
   - Discount Amount = 3.139% of $28.17 ≈ $0.886.
   - Final Cost After Discount = $28.17 - $0.886 ≈ $27.28.

3. **Determine Minimum Bid Price:**
   - To ensure a profit, the bid price must be at least equal to the final cost after discount.
   - Therefore, the minimum acceptable bid price is $27.28.

Since P2's cost is approximately $27.28, the optimal bid price is $27.28 to ensure at least a break-even or profit.

To determine the optimal bid price as Player P2, I need to calculate the total manufacturing cost per unit and then apply the standard pricing policy to set the final price.

1. **Base Material Cost**: The procurement department negotiated a base material cost of $28.882 per unit.

2. **Overhead Costs**: Overhead costs add 22.318% to production costs.
   - Overhead Cost = $28.882 * 22.318% = $28.882 * 0.22318 ≈ $6.455

3. **Total Manufacturing Cost**: Add the base material cost and overhead costs.
   - Total Manufacturing Cost = $28.882 + $6.455 ≈ $35.337

4. **Volume Incentive**: The supplier offers a volume incentive of 2.500% per unit.
   - Volume Incentive = $35.337 * 2.500% = $35.337 * 0.025 ≈ $0.883

5. **Adjusted Total Cost**: Subtract the volume incentive from the total manufacturing cost.
   - Adjusted Total Cost = $35.337 - $0.883 ≈ $34.454

6. **Final Price**: Apply the standard pricing policy of 2.348x the total manufacturing cost.
   - Final Price = $34.454 * 2.348 ≈ $80.84

Since the calculated final price is above P1's price, I should not bid to avoid losing money.

To determine the optimal bid price for Player P2, I need to analyze both P2's cost structure and P1's pricing formula.

**P2's Cost Structure:**
1. **Base Material Cost:** $26.269 per unit.
2. **Overhead Costs:** 37.363% of production costs.
   - Production Cost = Base Material Cost + Overhead
   - Overhead = 26.269 * 0.37363 ≈ $9.839
   - Total Production Cost ≈ 26.269 + 9.839 ≈ $36.108
3. **Volume Incentive:** 3.906% discount on production costs.
   - Volume Incentive = 36.108 * 0.03906 ≈ $1.409
   - Total Cost ≈ 36.108 - 1.409 ≈ $34.699

**P1's Pricing Formula:**
1. **Direct Costs:** $18.599 per unit.
2. **Overhead:** 49.117% of direct costs.
   - Overhead = 18.599 * 0.49117 ≈ $9.148
   - Total Cost ≈ 18.599 + 9.148 ≈ $27.747
3. **Profit Margin:** 28% of final price before adjustment.
   - Let Final Price before adjustment = P
   - Profit = 0.28P
   - P1's Cost + Profit = 27.747 + 0.28P
   - P1's Final Price before adjustment = P
   - P1's Final Price after adjustment = P * 1.10
   - Therefore, 27.747 + 0.28P = P
   - Solving for P: 27.747 = 0.72P → P ≈ $38.537
   - P1's Final Price ≈ 38.537 * 1.10 ≈ $42.391

**Optimal Bid for P2:**
- P2's Total Cost ≈ $34.699
- To win the sale, P2 should bid slightly below P1's final price.
- P2's Bid ≈ $42.39

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we first calculate the cost structure. The raw material cost is $25.667 per unit. Manufacturing overhead adds 25.027%, so the total cost is 25.667 * 1.25027 ≈ $32.10. The supplier offers a 2.136% discount, reducing the cost to 32.10 * 0.97864 ≈ $31.34. Since P2's cost is lower than P1's break-even price of $27.75, P2 can afford to bid slightly above $27.75 to win the sale. Setting the bid at $28 ensures a profit while staying competitive.

To determine the optimal bid price as P2, I need to calculate my total cost per unit and then decide on a bid price that maximizes profit while considering P1's pricing strategy.

1. **Calculate Material Costs**:  
   Material costs per unit = $27.035.

2. **Calculate Factory Overhead**:  
   Factory overhead = 27.887% of material costs = 0.27887 * 27.035 ≈ $7.55.

3. **Total Cost Before Discounts**:  
   Total cost = Material costs + Factory overhead = $27.035 + $7.55 ≈ $34.585.

4. **Apply Supplier Discount**:  
   Supplier discount = 2.402% of total cost = 0.02402 * $34.585 ≈ $0.83.  
   Total cost after discount = $34.585 - $0.83 ≈ $33.755.

5. **Calculate P1's Pricing**:  
   P1's direct costs = $9.735.  
   P1's overhead = 41.622% of direct costs = 0.41622 * $9.735 ≈ $4.06.  
   P1's total cost before profit and market adjustment = $9.735 + $4.06 ≈ $13.795.  
   P1's required profit margin = 28% of final price before adjustment.  
   Let P1's final price before adjustment be P.  
   Then, P1's profit margin = 0.28P.  
   Total cost + profit = P → $13.795 + 0.28P = P → $13.795 = 0.72P → P ≈ $19.16.  
   P1's final price after market adjustment = P + 10% of P = 1.1P ≈ $21.07.

6. **Determine Optimal Bid for P2**:  
   To win the sale, P2's bid must be lower than P1's final price of $21.07.  
   P2's total cost after discount is $33.755, which is significantly higher than P1's final price.  
   Therefore, P2 should not bid as it would result in a loss.

Alright, let's break this down step by step to determine the optimal bid price for P2.

**Step 1: Calculate P2's Total Cost**

- **Raw Materials Cost**: $23.449 per unit.
- **Manufacturing Overhead**: 20.757% of the base cost.
  
  Overhead = 23.449 * 0.20757 ≈ $4.867
  
- **Supplier Discount**: 3.861% off the total cost.
  
  Total Cost before discount = 23.449 + 4.867 ≈ $28.316
  
  Discount = 28.316 * 0.03861 ≈ $1.094
  
  **Net Cost for P2**: 28.316 - 1.094 ≈ $27.222

**Step 2: Determine P1's Pricing Formula**

- **Direct Costs**: $7.017 per unit.
- **Overhead**: 40.376% of direct costs.
  
  Overhead = 7.017 * 0.40376 ≈ $2.834
  
  **Total Cost before Profit and Adjustment**: 7.017 + 2.834 ≈ $9.851
- **Required Profit Margin**: 28% of the final price before adjustment.
- **Market Positioning Adjustment**: 10% increase on the final price before adjustment.

**Step 3: Calculate P1's Final Price**

Let’s denote P1’s final price before adjustment as \( P \).

- Profit margin = 0.28P
- Total cost + profit = 9.851 + 0.28P
- After adjustment: \( (9.851 + 0.28P) * 1.10 \)

Set this equal to P (since it's the final price):

\[ 1.10(9.851 + 0.28P) = P \]

Expanding:

\[ 10.8361 + 0.308P = P \]

Subtract 0.308P from both sides:

\[ 10.8361 = 0.692P \]

Solve for P:

\[ P ≈ 15.66 \]

**Step 4: P1's Final Price**

After adjustment, P1's price is:

\[ 15.66 * 1.10 ≈ 17.23 \]

**Step 5: Determine P2's Optimal Bid**

To win the sale, P2 must bid just below P1's price. The closest lower price without incurring a loss is slightly below $17.23. However, P2's net cost is approximately $27.222, which is significantly higher than P1's final price. 

**Conclusion:**

Since P2's cost is higher than P1's price, bidding would result in a loss. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to not bid.

Let me break down the problem step by step to determine the optimal bid price for Player P2.

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Both P1 and P2 are competing to sell a single unit to Buyer B.
   - Buyer B will choose the lowest bid.
   - If P2 wins, profit is (Bid Price - True Cost).
   - If P2 loses, profit is zero.

2. **Analyzing P1's Cost Structure:**
   - P1's Break-Even Volume: 12,000 units.
   - Fixed Costs: $230,975.542.
   - Contribution Margin Ratio (CMR): 38.683%.

   **Calculating P1's Variable Cost:**
   - Contribution per unit = (Price × CMR) - Variable Cost.
   - At break-even, Total Contribution = Fixed Costs.
   - Let Price be \( P \) and Variable Cost be \( VC \).
   - \( 12,000 \times (P \times 0.38683 - VC) = 230,975.542 \).

   However, without P1's selling price, I can't directly compute P1's variable cost. I'll proceed with P2's costs.

3. **Calculating P2's Total Cost:**
   - Raw Material Cost: $29.937 per unit.
   - Manufacturing Overhead: 31.184% of raw material cost.
   - Supplier Discount: 4.845% off the total cost.

   **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Raw Material Cost: $29.937.
   - Overhead: \( 29.937 \times 0.31184 = 9.338 \).
   - Total Cost Before Discount: \( 29.937 + 9.338 = 39.275 \).
   - Discount: \( 39.275 \times 0.04845 = 1.901 \).
   - Final Cost: \( 39.275 - 1.901 = 37.374 \).

4. **Determining the Optimal Bid:**
   - To win, P2's bid must be lower than P1's.
   - However, without P1's exact cost, I can't definitively set a price lower than theirs.
   - To ensure a profit, P2 should bid just below P1's price, but without knowing P1's exact cost, it's impossible to determine a safe bid.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Without P1's exact cost, P2 cannot confidently set a bid that ensures a profit while being competitive.

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, I need to calculate the cost structure and profit margin for both P1 and P2.

First, calculate P1's cost and price:
- P1's fixed costs: $108,255.17
- P1's variable costs: $9.529 per unit
- Total annual units: 10,000
- Operating margin: 25.699%

P1's total costs = Fixed costs + (Variable cost per unit * Units) = $108,255.17 + ($9.529 * 10,000) = $203,784.17
P1's revenue = Total costs / (1 - Operating margin) = $203,784.17 / 0.74301 ≈ $273,320.52
P1's price per unit = Revenue / Units = $273,320.52 / 10,000 ≈ $27.33

Next, calculate P2's cost and optimal bid:
- Material cost per unit: $22.426
- Factory overhead: 34.283% of material cost = $22.426 * 0.34283 ≈ $7.71
- Total cost per unit: $22.426 + $7.71 ≈ $30.14
- Supplier discount: 4.503% off if P2 orders more than 1 unit. Since P2 is selling one unit, no discount applies.

P2's cost per unit is $30.14. To win the sale, P2 must bid below P1's price of $27.33. However, P2's cost is higher than P1's price, making it unprofitable to bid.

To determine the optimal bid price as Player P2, I need to calculate the cost structure and then decide on a price that maximizes profit while considering P1's pricing strategy.

**Step 1: Calculate P1's Pricing Formula**

P1's cost breakdown:
- Direct costs = $10.472
- Overhead = 49.976% of direct costs
- Profit margin = 28.000% of final price before adjustment
- Final price adjustment = 10.000% increase for market positioning

Calculations:
1. Overhead = 0.49976 * 10.472 ≈ $5.233
2. Total costs before profit = Direct costs + Overhead = 10.472 + 5.233 ≈ $15.705
3. Let P1's final price before adjustment be \( P \).
4. Profit margin = 0.28 * P
5. Total price before adjustment = Total costs + Profit margin = 15.705 + 0.28P
6. Final price = Total price before adjustment * 1.10 (10% increase)

To solve for P:
Final price = 1.10 * (15.705 + 0.28P)
Let’s assume the final price is F:
F = 1.10 * (15.705 + 0.28P)
We need to find P such that F is consistent. However, without additional information, we can infer that P1's final price will be higher than their total costs plus profit margin.

**Step 2: Calculate P2's Cost Structure**

P2's cost breakdown:
- Base material cost = $25.545
- Overhead = 27.793% of production costs
- Volume incentive = 2.984% per unit

Calculations:
1. Overhead = 0.27793 * (25.545 + 0) ≈ $7.123
2. Total production costs = Base material cost + Overhead = 25.545 + 7.123 ≈ $32.668
3. Volume incentive = 0.02984 * 32.668 ≈ $0.984
4. Total costs after incentive = Total production costs - Volume incentive ≈ 32.668 - 0.984 ≈ $31.684

**Step 3: Determine Optimal Bid Price**

To maximize profit, P2 should set a price slightly below P1's final price. However, without knowing P1's exact final price, I can estimate based on the given information.

Assuming P1's final price is significantly higher due to their markup, P2 should set a competitive price just below P1's to win the sale.

**Final Bid Price:**

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we need to calculate the cost structure and target price based on the given information.

1. **P1's Cost Structure:**
   - Fixed Costs: $40,424.229 annually
   - Variable Costs: $7.589 per unit
   - Annual Production: 10,000 units
   - Operating Margin: 34.632%

   **Calculations for P1:**
   - Total Cost (TC1) = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost × Units) = $40,424.229 + (10,000 × $7.589) = $40,424.229 + $75,890 = $116,314.229
   - Total Revenue (TR1) = TC1 / (1 - Operating Margin) = $116,314.229 / (1 - 0.34632) ≈ $176,750.55
   - Price per Unit (P1_price) = TR1 / Units = $176,750.55 / 10,000 ≈ $17.675

2. **P2's Cost Structure:**
   - Base Material Cost: $24.568 per unit
   - Overhead Costs: 20.396% of production costs
   - Volume Incentive: 3.208% per unit

   **Calculations for P2:**
   - Assume P2 produces 1 unit.
   - Total Material Cost = $24.568
   - Overhead Cost = 20.396% of $24.568 ≈ $4.998
   - Total Cost (TC2) = Material Cost + Overhead Cost = $24.568 + $4.998 ≈ $29.566
   - Volume Incentive = 3.208% of $24.568 ≈ $0.798
   - Adjusted Total Cost = TC2 - Volume Incentive ≈ $29.566 - $0.798 ≈ $28.768

3. **Target Price for P2:**
   To win the sale, P2 should set a price just below P1's price per unit.
   - P1_price ≈ $17.675
   - P2 should bid slightly below this, say $17.50.

Let me calculate the optimal bid price for Player 2 (P2) in this pricing game.

**Step 1: Calculate P1's Cost Structure**

P1's factory operates at 10,000 units annually with:
- Fixed costs: $126,927.815
- Variable cost: $5.604 per unit
- Operating margin: 26.638%

First, calculate P1's total cost:
Total Cost = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost × Quantity)
Total Cost = $126,927.815 + (10,000 × $5.604) = $126,927.815 + $56,040 = $182,967.815

Next, calculate P1's selling price based on the operating margin:
Operating Margin = (Selling Price - Total Cost) / Selling Price
0.26638 = (Selling Price - $182,967.815) / Selling Price
Solving for Selling Price:
Selling Price × 0.26638 = Selling Price - $182,967.815
$182,967.815 = Selling Price × (1 - 0.26638)
Selling Price = $182,967.815 / 0.73362 ≈ $249.42

So, P1's selling price is approximately $249.42.

**Step 2: Calculate P2's Cost Structure**

P2's costs include:
- Material cost: $23.927 per unit
- Factory overhead: 34.786% of material costs
- Supplier discount: 4.486% per unit ordered

First, calculate P2's total cost per unit:
Factory Overhead = 0.34786 × $23.927 ≈ $8.28
Total Cost per Unit = Material Cost + Factory Overhead ≈ $23.927 + $8.28 ≈ $32.207

Next, calculate the supplier discount. Assuming P2 orders 1 unit:
Supplier Discount = 0.04486 × $32.207 ≈ $1.447
Adjusted Total Cost per Unit = Total Cost - Supplier Discount ≈ $32.207 - $1.447 ≈ $30.76

**Step 3: Determine P2's Optimal Bid**

To win the sale, P2's bid must be lower than P1's selling price of $249.42.

P2's cost per unit after discounts is approximately $30.76. To maximize profit, P2 should set the bid just below P1's price.

**Final Bid Price:**
P2 should bid $249.42 - ε (where ε is a very small amount). However, since we need to provide a specific value, P2 can bid just below $249.42, say $249.41.

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we need to calculate the total manufacturing cost and apply the standard pricing policy.

1. **Base Material Cost**: $29.983 per unit.

2. **Overhead Costs**: 34.321% of production costs. Since the base material cost is $29.983, the overhead cost is 34.321% of $29.983.

3. **Volume Incentive**: 4.755% discount on the total manufacturing cost. This reduces the total manufacturing cost.

4. **Total Manufacturing Cost (TMC)**: Base material cost + overhead costs - volume incentive.

5. **Final Price**: 2.364x TMC.

Let’s calculate each step:

- **Overhead Cost**: 0.34321 * 29.983 ≈ $10.31
- **Volume Incentive**: 0.04755 * (29.983 + 10.31) ≈ 0.04755 * 40.293 ≈ $1.914
- **TMC**: 29.983 + 10.31 - 1.914 ≈ $38.38
- **Final Price**: 2.364 * 38.38 ≈ $90.82

P2 should bid **$90.82** to maximize profit.

To determine the optimal bid price as Player P2, I need to calculate my total manufacturing cost and then apply the standard pricing policy to set the final price. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Material Costs**: My material costs are $30.780 per unit.

2. **Factory Overhead**: The factory overhead is allocated at 35.815% of material costs. 
   - Factory Overhead = 30.780 * 0.35815 ≈ $11.024.

3. **Total Manufacturing Cost (TMC)**: 
   - TMC = Material Costs + Factory Overhead = 30.780 + 11.024 ≈ $41.804.

4. **Supplier Discount**: My supplier offers a 2.050% discount per unit ordered. Since I'm producing one unit, the discount is:
   - Discount = 41.804 * 0.0205 ≈ $0.857.

5. **Adjusted Total Manufacturing Cost (Adjusted TMC)**:
   - Adjusted TMC = TMC - Discount = 41.804 - 0.857 ≈ $40.947.

6. **Final Price**: The standard pricing policy sets the final price at 2.310x of the total manufacturing cost.
   - Final Price = 2.310 * 40.947 ≈ $94.59.

Since P1's price is likely higher than mine, I should bid to win the sale.

### Step-by-Step Analysis for Player P2 (You):

1. **Understand the Game:**
   - You and P1 are competing to sell a single unit to buyer B.
   - Buyer B will choose the lowest priced offer.
   - If you win, your profit is the difference between your bid and your true cost.
   - If you lose, your profit is zero.

2. **Determine Your True Cost:**
   - Material Cost: $25.819 per unit.
   - Factory Overhead: 20.419% of material costs.
     - Calculation: $25.819 * 20.419% = $5.275.
   - Total Cost per Unit: Material Cost + Factory Overhead = $25.819 + $5.275 = $31.094.
   - Progressive Discount: 3.209% discount per unit ordered.
     - Since you're selling one unit, the discount is 3.209% of $31.094.
     - Calculation: $31.094 * 3.209% ≈ $1.000.
   - Final Cost per Unit: $31.094 - $1.000 = $30.094.

3. **Understand P1's Cost Structure:**
   - P1's Annual Production: 10,000 units.
   - Fixed Costs: $115,062.652.
   - Variable Cost per Unit: $9.729.
   - Total Annual Cost: Fixed + (Variable * Units) = $115,062.652 + (10,000 * $9.729) = $212,561.652.
   - Operating Margin Policy: 33.047%.
     - To achieve this margin, P1's selling price must cover all costs and provide the required margin.

4. **Calculate P1's Selling Price:**
   - Total Annual Revenue Needed: Total Annual Cost / (1 - Operating Margin).
     - Calculation: $212,561.652 / (1 - 0.33047) ≈ $316,800.
   - Selling Price per Unit: Total Revenue / Units = $316,800 / 10,000 ≈ $31.68.

5. **Determine Your Optimal Bid:**
   - To win the sale, your bid must be lower than P1's selling price.
   - Your Maximum Profitable Bid: Just below P1's selling price.
   - Since P1's selling price is approximately $31.68, you should bid just below this to ensure you win and maximize profit.
   - However, your true cost is $30.094, so you can afford to bid slightly below $31.68.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Bid at a price just below P1's selling price to win the sale.
   - Optimal Bid: $31.67.

Step 1: Calculate My Total Cost  
- Raw materials cost: $29.345  
- Manufacturing overhead: 38.161% of $29.345  
  Overhead = 0.38161 * 29.345 ≈ $11.19  
- Total Cost = $29.345 + $11.19 ≈ $40.535  

Step 2: Apply Supplier Discount  
- Supplier discount: 3.134%  
- Discount Amount = 0.03134 * $40.535 ≈ $1.275  
- Final Cost After Discount = $40.535 - $1.275 ≈ $39.26  

Step 3: Determine Break-Even Price  
- To break even, set bid price equal to final cost:  
  Bid Price = $39.26  

Step 4: Consider P1's Pricing Strategy  
- P1's break-even volume and costs suggest their price is higher than mine.  
- To win, I should bid just below P1's price, but not below my break-even.  

Step 5: Final Decision  
- Bidding at $39.26 ensures I don't incur a loss.

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we need to calculate the cost structure and profit margin requirements.

1. **Material Cost**: $27.047 per unit.

2. **Factory Overhead**: 36.064% of material costs.
   - Factory Overhead = 0.36064 * 27.047 ≈ $9.757

3. **Total Cost per Unit** (Manufacturing Cost):
   - Total Cost = Material Cost + Factory Overhead
   - Total Cost ≈ $27.047 + $9.757 ≈ $36.804

4. **Supplier Discount**: 4.551% discount on each unit ordered.
   - Since P2 is selling one unit, the discount applies once.
   - Discount = 0.04551 * 36.804 ≈ $1.684
   - Adjusted Cost = Total Cost - Discount ≈ $36.804 - $1.684 ≈ $35.120

5. **Profit Margin Requirement**:
   - To ensure a competitive bid while maintaining profitability, a reasonable profit margin is 20%.
   - Desired Profit = 0.20 * Adjusted Cost ≈ 0.20 * $35.120 ≈ $7.024
   - Optimal Bid Price = Adjusted Cost + Desired Profit ≈ $35.120 + $7.024 ≈ $42.144

To determine the optimal bid price for Player P2 in this sequential pricing game, we need to calculate both P1's final price and P2's cost structure to decide the best strategy.

### Step 1: Calculate P1's Final Price
P1's pricing formula involves several steps:

1. **Direct Costs**: $9.986 per unit.
2. **Overhead**: 42.910% of direct costs.
   - Overhead = 9.986 * 0.42910 ≈ $4.281
3. **Profit Margin**: 28.000% of the final price before adjustment.
   - Let’s denote the final price before adjustment as \( P \). The profit margin is 0.28P.
   - Total cost (direct + overhead) = 9.986 + 4.281 ≈ $14.267
   - Therefore, \( P = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Profit Margin} \)
   - \( P = 14.267 + 0.28P \)
   - Solving for \( P \):
     - \( P - 0.28P = 14.267 \)
     - \( 0.72P = 14.267 \)
     - \( P ≈ 14.267 / 0.72 ≈ 19.815 \)
4. **Market Positioning Adjustment**: 10.000% increase on the final price before adjustment.
   - Final Price = 19.815 * 1.10 ≈ $21.797

So, P1's final price is approximately **$21.797**.

### Step 2: Calculate P2's Cost Structure
P2's cost structure includes:

1. **Raw Materials**: $26.661 per unit.
2. **Manufacturing Overhead**: 36.772% of the base cost.
   - Overhead = 26.661 * 0.36772 ≈ $9.804
3. **Supplier Discount**: 3.448% discount on the total cost (raw materials + overhead).
   - Total Cost before discount = 26.661 + 9.804 ≈ $36.465
   - Discount = 36.465 * 0.03448 ≈ $1.256
   - Net Cost = 36.465 - 1.256 ≈ $35.209

### Step 3: Determine P2's Optimal Bid
Since the buyer will choose the lowest price, P2 should aim to bid just below P1's price to win the sale. However, P2 must ensure that the bid price covers their costs to avoid a loss.

- P1's final price: $21.797
- P2's net cost: $35.209

Since P2's cost is significantly higher than P1's price, P2 cannot bid below their cost without incurring a loss. Therefore, it is not profitable for P2 to bid in this scenario.

Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to determine the cost structure of my product, P2, to understand the minimum price I should bid without incurring a loss.

1. **Base Material Cost**: $26.698 per unit.

2. **Overhead Costs**: These are added as 26.665% of the production costs. 
   - Production cost per unit = Base Material Cost + Overhead.
   - Overhead per unit = 26.665% of $26.698 = 0.26665 * 26.698 ≈ $7.100.
   - Therefore, Total Cost per unit (P2) = $26.698 + $7.100 ≈ $33.798.

3. **Volume Incentive**: The supplier offers a 2.595% incentive per unit.
   - Incentive per unit = 2.595% of $33.798 ≈ $0.877.
   - Therefore, Adjusted Cost per unit = $33.798 - $0.877 ≈ $32.921.

Now, let's analyze P1's cost structure to understand their probable bid.

1. **P1's Fixed Costs**: $51,328.061 annually.
2. **P1's Variable Costs**: $7.505 per unit.
3. **Operating Margin**: P1 maintains a 30.496% margin.
   - Let’s assume P1 sells at a price that gives them this margin.
   - Let’s denote P1's selling price as P1_price.
   - Their profit per unit = P1_price - Variable Cost - (Fixed Cost / Annual Units).
   - Given their annual units are 10,000, Fixed Cost per unit = $51,328.061 / 10,000 ≈ $5.133.
   - Therefore, Total Cost per unit for P1 = $7.505 + $5.133 ≈ $12.638.
   - To achieve a 30.496% margin, P1_price = Total Cost * (1 + Margin) = $12.638 * 1.30496 ≈ $16.53.

However, this seems too low compared to my adjusted cost of $32.921. There might be a misunderstanding in calculating P1's price. Let me re-express it.

Alternative approach:
- P1's profit = (Selling Price - Variable Cost - Fixed Cost per unit) * Units.
- Let’s denote P1's Selling Price as P1_price.
- Profit = (P1_price - $7.505 - $5.133) * 10,000.
- They maintain a 30.496% operating margin, so Profit = 30.496% of Revenue.
- Revenue = P1_price * 10,000.
- Therefore, Profit = 0.30496 * P1_price * 10,000.
- Equating the two expressions:
  (P1_price - $12.638) * 10,000 = 0.30496 * P1_price * 10,000.
- Simplifying:
  P1_price - $12.638 = 0.30496 * P1_price.
  P1_price * (1 - 0.30496) = $12.638.
  P1_price = $12.638 / 0.69504 ≈ $18.18.

Now, comparing my adjusted cost of $32.921 to P1's estimated bid of $18.18, if I bid at $32.92, P1 can bid lower and win. To ensure I don't lose money, I should not bid above my adjusted cost. Therefore, the optimal bid is just above my adjusted cost to ensure a profit, but since I can't bid below cost without losing, I should not bid at all.

To determine the optimal bid price for Player P2, we need to calculate the total cost per unit, considering all given factors. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Base Material Cost**: $21.723 per unit.

2. **Overhead Costs**: 31.279% of production costs. 
   - Overhead per unit = 0.31279 * $21.723 ≈ $6.78.

3. **Volume Incentive**: 2.267% discount per unit.
   - Volume incentive per unit = 0.02267 * $21.723 ≈ $0.49.

4. **Total Cost per Unit**:
   - Base cost + Overhead - Volume incentive
   - $21.723 + $6.78 - $0.49 ≈ $28.01.

Since the optimal strategy is to price just below P1's break-even price, which is calculated based on their fixed costs and contribution margin ratio, we set our price slightly lower than P1's break-even price to ensure a win. Therefore, the optimal bid is $28.01.

To determine the optimal bid price for Player P2, we need to calculate the cost structure and determine the minimum acceptable price to avoid losses while competing with P1.

**Step 1: Calculate P1's Cost Structure**

- **Fixed Costs (FC):** $211,222.456 annually
- **Variable Costs (VC):** $6.552 per unit
- **Annual Production (Q):** 10,000 units

**Total Variable Costs (TVC):** 
\[ TVC = Q \times VC = 10,000 \times 6.552 = 65,520 \]

**Total Operating Costs (TOC):**
\[ TOC = FC + TVC = 211,222.456 + 65,520 = 276,742.456 \]

**Operating Margin Policy:** 32.627%

**Revenue (R):**
\[ R = TOC \times (1 + \text{Operating Margin}) \]
\[ R = 276,742.456 \times 1.32627 = 366,366.56 \]

**Price per Unit (P1):**
\[ P1 = \frac{R}{Q} = \frac{366,366.56}{10,000} = 36.636656 \]

**Step 2: Calculate P2's Cost Structure**

- **Material Costs (MC):** $30.697 per unit
- **Factory Overhead (FO):** 32.594% of MC
\[ FO = 30.697 \times 0.32594 = 9.999999 \approx 10.00 \]

**Total Cost per Unit (TC):**
\[ TC = MC + FO = 30.697 + 10.00 = 40.697 \]

**Step 3: Consider Supplier Discount**

- **Discount:** 2.902% per unit
\[ \text{Discount} = TC \times 0.02902 = 40.697 \times 0.02902 \approx 1.181 \]

**Adjusted Cost per Unit (AC):**
\[ AC = TC - \text{Discount} = 40.697 - 1.181 = 39.516 \]

**Step 4: Determine Optimal Bid Price**

To ensure a profit, P2's bid should be just above P1's price:
\[ \text{Bid Price} = P1 + \epsilon \]
\[ \text{Bid Price} = 36.636656 + \epsilon \]

However, since P2's adjusted cost is higher than P1's price, it's not profitable to bid.

**Conclusion:**

P2 should not bid to avoid losses.

To determine the optimal bid price as P2, I need to calculate my total cost per unit and then decide on a bid price that maximizes my profit while considering P1's likely bid.

1. **Calculate Material Costs**: The material cost per unit is $29.958.

2. **Calculate Factory Overhead**: The factory overhead is 38.449% of material costs.
   - Factory Overhead = 0.38449 * 29.958 ≈ $11.52

3. **Calculate Total Cost per Unit**: Add material costs and factory overhead.
   - Total Cost = 29.958 + 11.52 ≈ $41.48

4. **Consider Supplier Discount**: The supplier offers a 2.562% discount per unit ordered. Since I'm producing one unit, the discount applies to the total cost.
   - Discount = 0.02562 * 41.48 ≈ $1.06
   - Total Cost after Discount = 41.48 - 1.06 ≈ $40.42

5. **Determine Bid Price Strategy**: To win the sale, my bid should be lower than P1's bid. However, I need to ensure that my bid covers my total cost after discount to avoid losses.

6. **Assess P1's Pricing**: P1's break-even volume is 12,000 units with fixed costs of $147,292.516 and a contribution margin ratio of 36.143%. This means P1's price is set to cover both fixed and variable costs, ensuring profitability.

7. **Final Bid Decision**: Given the complexity and uncertainty in accurately predicting P1's exact bid, the safest approach is to set my bid just below P1's expected price. However, without precise information on P1's exact cost structure, it's challenging to determine the exact bid price. To avoid potential losses, I will decide not to bid.

","534","24.61360007462317","29.9649170034867","First, I need to calculate my own break-even point to understand my cost structure.
My material cost per unit is $23.393.
Factory overhead is 34.127% of material costs, so I calculate that: 0.34127 * 23.393 = $7.986 approximately.
Adding this to material cost gives my total variable cost per unit: $23.393 + $7.986 = $31.379.
Now, considering the supplier discount of 4.498%, my effective variable cost is reduced by this discount: 0.04498 * $31.379 ≈ $1.411. So, my effective variable cost per unit is $31.379 - $1.411 ≈ $30. (I think I need to double-check this calculation.)
Wait, actually, the discount is on the material costs, not the total variable cost. Let me correct that.
So, the supplier discount applies only to material costs. Therefore, the discount per unit is 4.498% of $23.393, which is 0.04498 * 23.393 ≈ $1.053.
So, the discounted material cost per unit is $23.393 - $1.053 ≈ $22.34.
Then, adding the factory overhead of 34.127% of $22.34: 0.34127 * 22.34 ≈ $7.63.
So, total variable cost per unit after discount is $22.34 + $7.63 ≈ $29.97, which I can round to $30.
Next, I need to determine P1's break-even price to understand their cost structure.
P1's break-even volume is 12,000 units, with fixed costs of $93,155.398.
Their contribution margin ratio is 31.539%, which is (Price - Variable Cost)/Price = 0.31539.
Let’s denote P1's variable cost as V1. Then, (Price - V1)/Price = 0.31539 → 1 - V1/Price = 0.31539 → V1/Price = 0.68461 → V1 = 0.68461 * Price.
Total cost for P1 is Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost * Volume) = $93,155.398 + V1 * 12,000.
At break-even, Revenue = Total Cost → Price * 12,000 = $93,155.398 + V1 * 12,000.
Substituting V1 = 0.68461 * Price into the equation:
Price * 12,000 = $93,155.398 + 0.68461 * Price * 12,000
Let me compute 0.68461 * 12,000 = 8,215.32
So, Price * 12,000 = $93,155.398 + $8,215.32 * Price
Rearranging: Price * 12,000 - $8,215.32 * Price = $93,155.398
Price * (12,000 - 8,215.32) = $93,155.398
Price * 3,784.68 = $93,155.398
Price = $93,155.398 / 3,784.68 ≈ $24.60
So, P1's break-even price is approximately $24.60.
Now, since I am P2, I need to determine my break-even price. My total cost per unit is $30, as calculated earlier.
To break even, I need to cover my costs. If I sell at price P2, then:
P2 - Variable Cost = Contribution Margin
Assuming I have fixed costs, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think I need to focus on covering my variable costs to at least avoid loss.
If I don't win the bid, my profit is zero. If I win, my profit is P2 - Variable Cost.
To ensure I don't incur a loss, I need P2 >= Variable Cost. My Variable Cost is $30, so I need to bid at least $30.
But wait, if I bid exactly $30, my profit per unit is zero. Since the buyer will choose the lowest price, if P1's price is $24.60, and mine is $30, I would lose the sale, making my profit zero. So, I need to bid lower than P1's price to win.
But if I bid lower than $30, I would be selling below my variable cost, incurring a loss per unit. However, if I can sell multiple units, I might cover fixed costs. But the problem states it's a single unit sale, so I can only sell one unit. Therefore, if I bid below $30, I would lose money on that single unit.
Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated my variable cost. Let me double-check:
Material cost: $23.393
Discount: 4.498% of $23.393 = 0.04498 * 23.393 ≈ $1.053
So, discounted material cost: $23.393 - $1.053 ≈ $22.34
Factory overhead: 34.127% of $22.34 ≈ 0.34127 * 22.34 ≈ $7.63
Total variable cost: $22.34 + $7.63 ≈ $29.97, which is roughly $30.
Therefore, my break-even price is $30. If I bid $30, I break even. If I bid below, I lose money.
Since P1's break-even price is $24.60, which is lower than mine, they can afford to bid lower. If I bid at $30, I might not win because P1 can bid lower. But if I bid lower than $30, I lose money.
Therefore, as P2, I should not bid because I cannot","tensor([5338,   11,  358,  ..., 1576,  358, 4157], device='cuda:0')"

As Player 2 (P2), I need to determine the optimal bid price to maximize my profit while considering Player 1 (P1)'s pricing strategy.

### Step 1: Calculate P1's Pricing Formula

P1's pricing formula is as follows:

1. **Direct Costs**: $10.678 per unit.
2. **Overhead Costs**: 47.172% of direct costs.
3. **Profit Margin**: 28.000% of the final price before adjustment.
4. **Market Positioning Adjustment**: 10.000% increase to the final price.

Let's compute P1's final price step by step.

1. **Overhead Costs**:
   \[
   \text{Overhead} = 10.678 \times 0.47172 = 5.058
   \]
2. **Total Cost Before Profit**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10.678 + 5.058 = 15.736
   \]
3. **Profit Margin**:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 15.736 \times 0.28 = 4.406
   \]
4. **Final Price Before Adjustment**:
   \[
   \text{Price Before Adjustment} = 15.736 + 4.406 = 20.142
   \]
5. **Market Positioning Adjustment**:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20.142 \times 1.10 = 22.156
   \]

### Step 2: Determine P2's Cost Structure

P2's cost structure is as follows:

1. **Base Material Cost**: $21.874 per unit.
2. **Overhead Costs**: 37.504% of production costs.
3. **Volume Incentive**: 3.351% per unit.

Let's compute P2's total cost.

1. **Overhead Costs**:
   \[
   \text{Overhead} = 21.874 \times 0.37504 = 8.229
   \]
2. **Volume Incentive**:
   \[
   \text{Volume Incentive} = 21.874 \times 0.03351 = 0.733
   \]
3. **Total Cost**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 21.874 + 8.229 + 0.733 = 30.836
   \]

### Step 3: Determine Optimal Bid Price for P2

To maximize profit, P2 should set a bid price slightly below P1's final price. If P2 sets the bid price equal to P1's final price, P2 would not win the sale since the buyer chooses the lowest price. If P2 sets the bid price below P1's final price, P2 can win the sale and make a profit.

Given that P1's final price is $22.156, P2 should set the bid price just below this amount. However, since we are to provide a specific price, P2 can set the bid price at $22.156 - ε (where ε is a very small amount). For practical purposes, P2 can set the bid price at $22.156.

### Conclusion

P2's optimal bid price is $22.156 to ensure a win and maximize profit.

To determine the optimal bid price for Player 2 (P2), I need to calculate the total cost per unit, including all relevant expenses, and then decide whether it's profitable to bid against P1.

1. **Calculate the Base Material Cost:**
   - Base material cost = $25.532 per unit.

2. **Add Overhead Costs:**
   - Overhead costs add 23.889% to production costs.
   - Overhead cost per unit = 25.532 * 0.23889 ≈ $6.111.
   - Total cost before volume incentive = 25.532 + 6.111 ≈ $31.643.

3. **Apply Volume Incentive:**
   - Volume incentive reduces costs by 3.506%.
   - Volume incentive savings per unit = 31.643 * 0.03506 ≈ $1.110.
   - Total cost after incentive = 31.643 - 1.110 ≈ $30.533.

4. **Determine P1's Pricing:**
   - P1's break-even volume is 12,000 units.
   - P1's fixed costs = $95,589.131.
   - Contribution margin ratio = 33.185%.
   - Let P1's price per unit = P.
   - Variable cost per unit for P1 = P * (1 - 0.33185) ≈ 0.66815P.
   - At break-even: Total revenue = Total cost.
   - P1's revenue = 12,000 * P.
   - P1's total cost = Fixed costs + Variable costs = 95,589.131 + 12,000 * 0.66815P.
   - At break-even: 12,000P = 95,589.131 + 12,000 * 0.66815P.
   - Solving for P:
     - 12,000P - 12,000 * 0.66815P = 95,589.131
     - 12,000P * (1 - 0.66815) = 95,589.131
     - 12,000P * 0.33185 ≈ 95,589.131
     - P ≈ 95,589.131 / (12,000 * 0.33185) ≈ 95,589.131 / 4,000.2 ≈ $23.90.

5. **Decide P2's Bid:**
   - P2's total cost per unit ≈ $30.533.
   - To win, P2's bid must be lower than P1's price of $23.90.
   - However, P2's cost is higher than P1's price, making it unprofitable to bid.
   - Therefore, P2 should not bid.

To determine the optimal bid price for P2, we need to calculate the minimum acceptable price based on costs and compare it to P1's price. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate P1's Cost Structure:**
   - **Fixed Costs:** $222,447.91
   - **Variable Costs:** $9.841 per unit
   - **Annual Production:** 10,000 units

   **Total Variable Costs = 10,000 units * $9.841 = $98,410**
   
   **Total Costs = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs = $222,447.91 + $98,410 = $320,857.91**

2. **Determine P1's Price Based on Operating Margin:**
   - **Operating Margin:** 25.786%
   - **Desired Profit = Total Costs * Operating Margin = $320,857.91 * 0.25786 ≈ $82,722.68**

   **Price per Unit = (Total Costs + Desired Profit) / Annual Production**
   **Price per Unit = ($320,857.91 + $82,722.68) / 10,000 ≈ $40.36**

3. **Calculate P2's Cost Structure:**
   - **Raw Material Cost:** $27.761 per unit
   - **Manufacturing Overhead:** 25.181% of base cost
   - **Supplier Discount:** 3.076% per unit

   **Base Cost per Unit = Raw Material Cost + Manufacturing Overhead**
   **Base Cost per Unit = $27.761 + ($27.761 * 0.25181) ≈ $27.761 + $6.99 ≈ $34.75**

   **Net Cost per Unit After Discount = Base Cost * (1 - Discount Rate)**
   **Net Cost per Unit = $34.75 * (1 - 0.03076) ≈ $34.75 * 0.96924 ≈ $33.69**

4. **Determine P2's Minimum Bid Price:**
   To ensure a profit, P2 should set the bid price just below P1's price. Since P2's cost is approximately $33.69, the optimal bid price is just below $40.36.

","360","44.700234967803794","32.06177385482772","First, I need to calculate P1's cost structure to determine their minimum acceptable bid.
P1 has fixed costs of $214,704.305 and variable costs of $8.140 per unit, with an annual production of 10,000 units.
Their operating margin is 33.758%, which means they aim to make a profit equal to 33.758% of their cost.
So, P1's total cost per unit is fixed cost per unit plus variable cost.
Fixed cost per unit = $214,704.305 / 10,000 units = $21.4704305
Variable cost per unit = $8.140
Total cost per unit = $21.4704305 + $8.140 = $29.6104305
Their target selling price must be 33.758% higher than this total cost to achieve the operating margin.
So, target price = $29.6104305 * (1 + 0.33758) ≈ $39.71
Therefore, P1's minimum acceptable bid is approximately $39.71.

Now, let's calculate my own cost structure to determine my minimum acceptable bid.
My material cost per unit is $27.047.
Factory overhead is 21.875% of material costs, so overhead per unit = $27.047 * 0.21875 ≈ $5.914
Total cost per unit = $27.047 + $5.914 ≈ $32.961
Additionally, I have a supplier discount of 2.736% per unit ordered. Since I'm selling one unit, the discount is 2.736% of $32.961, which is approximately $0.899.
So, my effective cost per unit after discount = $32.961 - $0.899 ≈ $32.062
To ensure I don't incur a loss, I need to set my bid at least equal to my effective cost. Therefore, my minimum bid is approximately $32.06.

Since my minimum bid is lower than P1's minimum bid, I can afford to bid lower than P1's $39.71 and still make a profit. To maximize profit, I should set my bid just above my minimum to ensure I win the sale. However, since the exact price isn't specified, I can set it to my minimum cost to ensure I don't lose money. Therefore, I will bid $32.06.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Determine P1's Pricing Formula:**
   - **Direct Costs:** $9.889 per unit.
   - **Overhead Costs:** 41.977% of direct costs.
   - **Profit Margin:** 28.000% of the final price before adjustment.
   - **Market Adjustment:** 10.000% increase for market positioning.

2. **Calculate P1's Overhead:**
   \[
   \text{Overhead} = 9.889 \times 0.41977 = 4.165
   \]

3. **Calculate P1's Total Cost Before Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 9.889 + 4.165 = 14.054
   \]

4. **Calculate P1's Profit Margin:**
   \[
   \text{Profit Margin} = 14.054 \times 0.28 = 3.935
   \]

5. **Calculate P1's Final Price Before Market Adjustment:**
   \[
   \text{Final Price Before Adjustment} = 14.054 + 3.935 = 17.989
   \]

6. **Apply Market Adjustment:**
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 17.989 \times 1.10 = 19.788
   \]

7. **Determine P2's Cost Structure:**
   - **Base Material Cost:** $23.283 per unit.
   - **Overhead Costs:** 33.422% of production costs.
   - **Volume Incentive:** 4.663% per unit.

8. **Calculate P2's Overhead:**
   \[
   \text{Overhead} = 23.283 \times 0.33422 = 7.779
   \]

9. **Calculate P2's Total Cost Before Volume Incentive:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 23.283 + 7.779 = 31.062
   \]

10. **Apply Volume Incentive:**
    \[
    \text{Volume Incentive} = 31.062 \times 0.04663 = 1.453
    \]

11. **Calculate P2's Total Cost After Volume Incentive:**
    \[
    \text{Total Cost After Incentive} = 31.062 - 1.453 = 29.609
    \]

12. **Determine P2's Optimal Bid:**
    - To win the sale, P2 must bid lower than P1's final price of $19.788.
    - However, P2's total cost after incentives is $29.609, which is significantly higher than P1's final price.
    - Bidding below $19.788 would result in a loss.

### Conclusion:
Since P2's cost structure is too high to compete effectively with P1's pricing, the optimal strategy is to not bid.

Step 1: Calculate P1's final price using their pricing formula.
- **Direct Costs**: $18.713 per unit
- **Overhead**: 45.319% of direct costs
  - Overhead = 0.45319 * 18.713 ≈ $8.475
- **Total Cost Before Profit**: Direct Costs + Overhead ≈ 18.713 + 8.475 ≈ $27.188
- **Required Profit Margin**: 28.000% of final price before adjustment
  - Let Final Price before adjustment be \( FP \)
  - Total Cost + Profit = FP
  - 27.188 + 0.28 * FP = FP
  - Solving for FP: 0.72 * FP = 27.188 → FP ≈ $37.705
- **Market Positioning Adjustment**: 10.000% increase
  - Final Price = 1.10 * 37.705 ≈ $41.476

Step 2: Calculate P2's cost structure.
- **Base Material Cost**: $27.403 per unit
- **Overhead**: 27.552% of production costs
  - Overhead = 0.27552 * 27.403 ≈ $7.560
- **Total Cost**: Base Material Cost + Overhead ≈ 27.403 + 7.560 ≈ $34.963
- **Volume Incentive**: 3.110% reduction on total cost
  - Incentive = 0.0311 * 34.963 ≈ $1.084
- **Adjusted Total Cost**: Total Cost - Incentive ≈ 34.963 - 1.084 ≈ $33.879

Step 3: Determine P2's optimal bid price.
- To win the sale, P2 must bid lower than P1's final price of $41.476.
- The lowest feasible bid is just below P1's price to ensure a win.
- Therefore, P2 should bid **$41.47** to maximize profit while ensuring a sale.
