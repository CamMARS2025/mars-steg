    "    - First implementation was using a weighted average score, which induced the following issue : a random agent would have a constant reward of 0.5, whereas , in pricing game, a failing calculation of bid additioned to using P1 information was leading to a reward of 0. \n",

    "    - A higher `task_score` increases the reward.\n",
    "    - A higher `language_score` decreases the reward.\n",
